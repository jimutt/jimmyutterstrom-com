I’ve shared it on Twitter but just haven’t mentioned it here. A short while ago I put together a small chatroom example using Vue.js + Semantic UI for the front-end and Node with socket.io for the backend.

It’s a quite basic example that isn’t production ready but it still features the most important functionality as well asI’ve been usingsome of the new features of ES6 which can be interesting to look at if you haven’t already.

For more information and to see it in action and access the source code please visit the Github repo for the project: [https://github.com/jimutt/Vue.js-socket.io-chatroom-example](https://github.com/jimutt/Vue.js-socket.io-chatroom-example)
