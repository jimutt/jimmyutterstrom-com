Today the mailman delivered a small but stillvery anticipatedpackage. I just got the three [CY8CKIT-059 PSoC® 5LP](http://www.cypress.com/documentation/development-kitsboards/cy8ckit-059-psoc-5lp-prototyping-kit) prototyping boards I ordered about a week ago! I haven’t had time to try them yet but I’m looking forward to it!

The downside with larger prototyping boards like FreeSoC2 or the PSoC4 Pioneer board is that if you’re a hobbyist who can’t afford the time and cost to order a custom PCB when you’re done prototyping it can be hard to make the dev board fit in your project due to its physical size. That’s why I really like that Cypress is offering this cheap kit which allows for rapid prototyping with the snap-off programmer/debugger as well as it’s small enough to fit in many different applications. I would love to see more compact PSoC-solutions like this one in the future.

I’ll probably write a new post when I’ve had the chance to test them!
